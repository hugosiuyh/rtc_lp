I was here on December 2023 and myself and around 8 people all had their phones suddenly lifted. I noticed more and more people having a look of pandemonium on their faces and realized that multiple people were being targeted. The club doesnt do anything about this. Suddenly this weekend when my best friend reports she is going back to this club around 8 months since this instance, her phone is also stolen. How much of a fing coincidence is that? And same story, multiple people (5+) all getting their phone lifted at the same and running around mad looking for it. Just think of how many had their phone stolen in between those two visits. Its not normal and of course when we told their security they shrugged, which was very gracious of them given how awful they are.

This was after our group was slammed multiple times by drunk people trying to hop the boundary near the VIP section. This time, when she fell into us, so as we righted ourselves up, the person in our group who she slammed into glared at her. She then threatened him and said Dont play with me and quickly went to security who ten minutes later, pulled our group outside. Because we were not given wrist  stamps, we were not allowed re-entry. While outside, we were directed to the manager - Josh, a brunette curly haired 511 white male who had been working at 1015 Folsom for 7 years and said that he never had a complaint from her. He told us that we had shoved her and when an employee complains about a guest, they have every right to refuse entry for any reason. Funny to say when while we were waiting to speak with him, we were shoved right in front of their faces by another unruly crowd, but of course while he was on his power trip, he ignored that. We quietly waited our turn to speak with the bottle service lady who had reported us to security. When she showed up, she started her explanation with if you were a woman and a guy glares at you the way your friend did, that would make you feel very uncomfortable.  She also said our friends attitude made her feel uncomfortable. We reasoned with her that her fall on our friend actually took down 3 people total, and asked for her understanding that this kind of thing happens at a nightclub and we have every right to be annoyed and to right ourselves up and to glare at her. We also offered to apologize to her after trying to understand what we needed to apologize for but she changed her narrative mid explanation and said that we  did not touch her , but glared at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. We did not start a fight, did not strike her, and did not threaten her safety.  She completely skipped the fact that her fall physically knocked us over while our friends  attitude  left her unscathed. When we asked her what we should have done, she rolled her eyes at us before walking away. Of course, nothing happens when she is giving us a bad attitude under her managers watch. Overall the club lets in way too many people than it can support, which is really the root cause of these issues. Drink lines have long wait times, and when you actually need security or help (there were a few individuals throwing up in plain sight in trash cans on the staircase) they are nowhere to be found. People are pushing, stumbling, slipping, and shoving their way through crowds, and a glare is actually a luxury to receive when you act like a human bowling pin and barrel through a crowd. I hope karma really takes care of this place; looking through reviews, its not the first story about how the security at 1015 Folsom has power tripping behavior. If you find yourself wanting to come here to see a really nice DJ, dont go. Its not worth supporting a business that  actively supports its employees to treat their customers like trash, and its just a matter of time before you get binned too.",a year ago,2023-09-04 12:30:29.138380,,,,8,131,313,True,,

I was there in 2019 pre-Covid and hated the place, but they made MASSIVE improvements! There was plenty of staff at the entrance to get us in quick, super nice bartenders that kept the lines moving, upgraded layout (they took out the drop lights that blocked the stage from upstairs-HUGE improvement), nice clean bathrooms, 2 huge air fans on each side of the stage (I could swear they even had cooling misters which was awesome being packed in front and hot from dancing, but I m not positive if that was real  ) but best of all the sound and visuals were AMAZING and a huge upgrade. This just went from my least favorite SF venue to one I wouldn t hesitate to go back to! Thanks 1015!!",2 years ago,2022-09-04 12:30:32.959639,,,,12,19,3,True,,

An hour later, my friend messaged me that he couldnt get back inside after stepping outside for a smoke. Confused, I walk out to the designated smoking section to find him. I stepped maybe two meters away from the door, remained inside the barricade, but was suddenly rushed by security telling me I had stepped out into the exit zone, or something, and had to leave. Apparently theres some invisible, unmarked line that youre expected to see and if you cross this line, security throws you out no matter what. I tried to reason with the guards, and when i told them how disappointing this experience was, they replied thats youre problem.  This security team is not protecting respecting, sober paying customers. I feel like i was robbed by a gang of power hungry kids eager to flex their, i dont know what.
